Safy-iOS
========

__Description:__

Push notifications are hard. We know that. We used to have a lot of troubles with this at the office, that's why I create Safy, an iPad application that you can use as a safety scoreboard. Hopefully someone will find something useful here and I always appreciate feedback.
